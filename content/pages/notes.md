2. Variables that can be used in theme's templates (.html files): [pelican doc](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/themes.html#category-html)
    - All templates receives the variables defined in the settings file, 
    as long as they are in all-caps
    - Look at section [common variables](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/themes.html#common-variables) for other variable (ie. not from
