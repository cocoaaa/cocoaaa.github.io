<p>I'm a Computer Science PhD student at USC's <a href="https://vimal.isi.edu/">VIMAL</a> interested in how we understand observations from multiple modalities (e.g. images, audio signals and written texts), and how we extract and build representations of the semantics that is invariant across the multimodal observations.</p>
<p>Before starting my PhD, I studied Mathematics and EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at MIT for my Bachelors and Masters.  Along the way, I interned at a French robotics startup <em>Keecker</em> and academic research labs in MIT's CSAIL, Media Lab, McGovern Institute and in INRIA.  After my Masters, I worked at Apple as a COOP for 9 months.</p>
<p>My research interest lies at the intersection of <strong>representation learning</strong> and <strong>information</strong> theory, inspired by the way our perceptual system integrates <strong>multimodal</strong> sensory inputs via identifying <strong>invariant semantics</strong>.  I am interested in understanding how the <strong>semantic information</strong> flows while processing observations from multiple modalities, using tools in deep learning and thermodynamic approaches to information flow. </p>
<p>My current guiding question is, </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How do we  extract the shared semantics from observations expressed in vastly different representational forms (eg. images,  sounds, written texts), and how do we create/actualize various forms of observations, starting from the semantics we want to communicate?</em></p>
</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>I approach this question from an information-processing point of view and am developing <strong>generative models</strong> with <strong>disentangled representation</strong> to jointly learn the analysis and synthesis processes of multimodal data.  My most recent work introduces a generative model with adversarial training that learns spatial semantics from map tiles collected from diverse sources such as satellites, Google Street Map and custom rendering engines.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Read more about our dataset of multi-style map tiles (<a href="#">TBA</a>)</li>
<li>Read more about our work on Learning a structured ... (<a href="#">TBA</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, I am exploring different ways to understand our proposed model, in particular, by measuring semantic information and studying the flow of information between the latent partitions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How we can quantify the amount of the shared semantic information captured by our model?</li>
<li>If we view each latent partition as a subsystem that constitutes a global system represented by the whole latent space, then we can view the the adversarial discriminator as a demon (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon">Maxwell's Demon</a>) sitting at the boarder of the latent subsystems. </li>
</ul>
<!--- (How) does the adversary -- the demon sitting at the boarder of the content and style latent partitions -- achieve the non-equilibrium state of the semantic vs. domain-specific information by "sorting" or "organizing" the information into the correct partition as the training happens?-->
<ul>
<li>From this point of view, (how) does this adversary -- the demon sitting at the boarder of the content and style latent partitions -- achieve the non-equilibrium state of the semantic vs. domain-specific information by "sorting" or "organizing" the information into the correct partition as the training happens?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's exciting to see how the ideas and tools in thermodynamics can help quantify and visualize this flow of semantic information in our model :)</p>

<p>More specifically, I'm intrigued by how seamlessly we extract a common semantic content from observations in vastly different representational forms (such as languages, images, gestures or sounds, and infinitely many forms within each modality), and reversely, how a semantic content can be expressed in various forms without losing its (overall) meaning
<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-note"></label>
<input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-note" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
Hmm.. coarse-graining?</span>.</p>
<p>My exploration starts with an hypothesis that a phenomena in reality, from which
our observations stem from, contains <strong>semantic potentials</strong>("potential" as in
<em>potential energy</em> in Physics, or going further up the stream, as in Aristotle's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality">"Potentiality and actuality"</a>
<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-note"></label>
<input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-note" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
This idea influenced Leibniz to develop the science of "dynamics". 
Learning about such influence brings light into what Leibniz was struggling to hit the chord with ideas like 'power' and 'action'. Contemplate: Aristotle's "potential:actuality" vs. Leibniz's "power:action"</span>
.) </p>
<p>I wonder,</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the relationship between <em>semantic information</em><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-note"></label>

and <em>semantic potential</em>, i.e. the underlying <em>field</em> from which individual observations are actualized into an instance of a natural phenomena, an event?</li>
<li>What is the process -- or geometric constraints -- that leads the same semantics to different representational forms? Can we learn this process from multimodal data?</li>
<li>What is the process through which an observer builds an understanding -- an internal representation -- of an event?<ul>
<li>What is the process through which we identify, extract and encode the invariant semantics from observations in diverse modalities?</li>
<li>How can we define and measure the semantic information in our representations, efficiently?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can we model these processes by <strong>learning a generative model from data collected from multiple modalities</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 id="specific-example">Specific Example</h2>
<p>For instance, consider the following observations: <span class="math">\(X^A\)</span> is an image of a dog barking on the door, <span class="math">\(X^B\)</span> is a recording of a dog barking, and <span class="math">\(X^C\)</span> is a sentence written in the English language. The semantic content shared among the observations is "there is a dog barking", and each observation is the result of expressing (synm: rendering, stylizing) the semantic content into a form proper for its modality (ie. image, sound, written English language, respectively). </p>
<p>My question, at the representational level is, how do we identify the underlying, shared semantic contents from the information about domain-specific variations? 
<img alt="multi-modal-encoding-of-semantics" src="/images/semantic_potential/encoding-semantics-from-origin.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>How do we <em>identify</em> what is the type of information that is invariant among observations from multiple domains?</li>
<li>What discovery process goes into separating the shared contents (invariance across domain) from the domain-specifics?  </li>
<li>Can we use learning-based approaches to build a computational model of such process (i)more efficiently, (ii)by leveraging large amounts of data available?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's flip the question and consider the process of synthesis. I start with a concept that I'd like to express and communicate. For example, I want to actualize the idea of "a dog barking at the door". If I ask you to express this content as an image, sounds, and an English sentence, what would be the process of such domain-specific actualization of a semantic information?
<img alt="generating-semantics-in-multi-domains" src="/images/semantic_potential/generating-semantics-in-multiple-domains.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the process of recombining the encoded representations to make better decisions, derive new conclusions? In particular, what is the underlying structure that defines each modality?</li>
</ul>
<p>Geometry of a modality space: imposes geometric constraints that an instance must satisfy to be a valid observations of that modality
<img alt="geometry-of-modality-space" src="/images/semantic_potential/geometry-of-modality-space.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>E.g. an observation in an image form must satisfy a different set of geometric constraints than that in an acoustic form.</li>
<li>Can we learn a model of such geometric rules via a generative model with neural networks?</li>
</ul>
<p>The breakdown of main components of my questions looks as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic information: Address a limitation of Shannon's theory of Information<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-note"></label>
<input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-note" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
The symmetry axiom of Shannon's entropy preserves the syntactic meaning in symbols, yet disregards their identities. See <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/it.pdf">ITTP2018</a></span>.</li>
<li>Semantic potentials == a natural phenomena -- is this what "nature" is defined as?</li>
<li>The process of actualizing semantic potentials/information to different modalities</li>
<li>The process during which an observer builds an understanding of the actualized data point</li>
<li>Geometry of modality space: what is the underlying geometry that defines an observation as a valid image vs. a valid human voice vs. a valid text? </li>

<h3 id="learning-a-generative-model-of-multimodal-representation">Learning a generative model of multimodal representation</h3>
<p>In pursuit of this computational model of understanding and generating multimodal data, I am developing generative models with disentangled representation to jointly learn the analysis and synthesis processes of complex, high-dimensional data (eg. satellite images, knowledge bases) with compact and &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; representations.&nbsp; 
I'm working with Prof. Wael Abd-Almageed at ISI's <a href="https://vimal.isi.edu/">VIMAL</a>, 
focusing on various types of generative models for this goal.
My project with  Prof. <a href="https://spatial.usc.edu/team-view/yao-yi-chiang/">Yao-Yi Chiang</a> and Prof. <a href="https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/knoblock/">Craig Knoblock</a> tackles this line of questions using geospatial data, and aims to learn spatial semantics from data that are collected from diverse sources (eg. satellites, Google Street Map, historical maps) and stored in diverse format (eg. images, graphs). This work has potential applications such as global-scale urban environment analysis, automated map synthesis and systems for monitoring environmental changes.</p>
<!--- Read more about our maptile dataset [here](#).-->
<p>Within the domain of representation learning, I&rsquo;m most interested in variational inference methods, especially recent developments in deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the idea of adversarial training. </p>
<p>Using a VAE-variant model and adversarial training, I&rsquo;m investigating how we can build a model that extracts invariance in a dataset of heterogeneous representations via VAEs and adversarial training.&nbsp; One of my current projects investigates this question in the domain of spatial informatics, using our new dataset of map tiles from diverse sources.</p>

<li>Understanding adversary at the latent space from the perspectives of information flow and non-equilibrium achieved by the adversary, ie. the Maxwell's Demon at the gate that distinguishes the two latent partitions</li>
<ul>
<li>GAN models are often described in the framework of min-max games between a generator and an adversary. In particular, there has been works making a connection between Nash Equilibrium and local minimum of the GAN's objective function. This connection motivates me to view my adversary (at the latent partitions) as an 'information sorter', like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon">Maxwell's Demon</a>. The goal of this information sorter is to organize the semantic information into one latent partition, and the domain-specific information into the other latent partition, so that each partition (equivalent to a gas chamber in Maxwell's thought experiment) contains only its type of information.  This approach will allow me to bring in computational tools from information theory and theromodynamics (flow of information) to understand how the adversarial information sorter actually achieves the partitioned latent space. </li>
</ul>
<li>Evaluation of the disentangled partition requires a measure of semantic information </li>
<ul>
<li>In order to evaluate how well our semantic latent space captures the semantic information in the inputs, we first need a well grounded _definition of the semantic information_, as well as _computational methods to efficiently compute_ the value.</li>
