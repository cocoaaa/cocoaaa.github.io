Title: About Me

{% img ../images/profile.jpg %}

I'm a machine learning researcher studying how human intelligence can be 
computationally modeled.  
 
I like wiggling around and twisting little bits 
and pieces to understand a system, let it be a computer, a program or my own little brain.
Not always successful, but I'm relatively positive and resilient in face of failure.
Everyday I strive to grow up, be more responsible, and appreciate what I have.
I'm searching for something that is greater than myself, let that be other human beings,
or higher goals, one that can lightens my heart and soul and brings freedom from 
the trap of my own self. Whether that is a lover, passion, or purpose, I believe 
I will be a little bit closer to my true form when I find it.  This blog is a place 
for me to organize my daily thoughts and learnings, and share them with others 
so that they truly come alive with meanings.  By setting a foot into a wider and 
wilder Web, I might hope to feel more of part of a bigger community. 


I believe everything starts small. 
May this blog be a humble start of my courageous adventure into the fathomless rabbit
hole with eyes to face the invisible and persistent heart to honor the struggles.
May this be another small step in my journey to become a big adult.
