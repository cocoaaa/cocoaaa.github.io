## Before you start
Q: **"why are you reading this?"**

- Write it down where you can see it while reading the paper
    - Your purpose/goal of reading may change later.  You will have a different experience then. 
- Is there a clear answer for this question? If not,  you probably should not go on reading the paper

## Warm-up (1 hr)
Think of it like going on a date with a new person. It's a new relationship, so don't try/expect to understand it in one go -- this is rude:)

- Go to a quiet place for a few hours. Take your coffee with you

- Start by reading the title and abstract
    - Goal: gain a high level overview of the paper
    - What are the main goals of the authors?
    - What are the high level results?
    - What is the problem the paper is solving?

- Skim the paper (~15min)
    - Look at the figures
    - Jot down any keywords to look out for when reading
    - Goal: get a sense for the layout of the paper; get keywords to look out for
    
- Go to introduction, especially if you feel unfamiliar with the field/paper. Okay to do it often. 
    - Goal: get other references to fill in the gap in your understanding
    
- Carefully step through each figure
    - why?: each figure contain key points of the paper. Authors spend a lot of time creating them and try to condense important information that supports their experiments/hypothesis. Pay particular attention to them.
    - Goal: Gain feel for what the authors think is most important; **Write down** what to look out for when reading the paper in detail (which will follow soon)
    
- Take a break. Walk a bit. 

## First ~pass~ date (1.5hr)
Start taking high level notes. Expect new words, unfamiliar ideas. Mark those (you don't yet need to understand every single word), move on.

This is your first date with the paper. You are not going to learn all gory details about it, but you will ask good questions, understand what motivated the paper, and what it's going to be about. 

- Begin again with the **abstract**, skim through the **introduction***

- Diligent pass through the **methods** section
    - Goal: Draw down the overall setup
- Read the **results** and **discussion**
    - Goal: write down the key findings and how they were determined
    
- Take a break. Do jumping jacks. Sing a song.

 Let's continue.

- Revisit the **figures**: by now, you should be able to get into nitty gritties of the figures (having read the methods, results, and discussion section)
    - Goal: find more gems from the figures. 
    - Spend about 30min ~ 1hr
    
##  Second full pass (1-2hrs)
### Goal: 
- Focus on shoring up what you didn't understand previously,
- Gain a command of the **methods** section 
    - Test if you can write a pseudocode
- Being a critical reader of the **discussion** section

### Details: 
- Pay particular attention to the areas you marked as being difficult to understand. This is why you read a new paper. Don't play safe.  Okay to feel uncomfortable. Okay to do it the following day (but don't push it back too much).

- Leave no word undefined, unclear. Make sure you understand every sentence.
- Skim through areas you feel confident in (eg. abstract, intro, results)
