While making a visualization for my part whereabouts for the [front page](#) of this blog, I came across this easy-to-use visualization examples using `amcharts`.  Initially, I wanted to use Google Earth Studio but it required me to import country boundaries (in KML files) as well as time to learn new toolsuites, so I find this javascript based demos more useful for my need. 

List of timeline + map charts
- [Fishbone timeline](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/fishbone-timeline/)
- [Fight routes on map](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/flight-routes-map/)
- [Flight animation on map](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/animations-along-lines/)
- [Timeline animation with fligh on map](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/map-line-chart-gauge/)
- and many more [demos](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/#maps)


Pretty neat!
