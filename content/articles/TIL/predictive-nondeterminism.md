Often confusing categorization of a mathematical model:

    - NB: in CS, people often use "deterministic" to mean non-randomized. This causes confusion:
        > "Determinism" means non-randomized. But, "Non-determinism" does **not** mean "randomized".
- Determinism vs. Non-Determinism
- ...? vs. stochastic/random 
    - a stochastic (or random) process means,

I think better way to put this confusion into words is: "Nondeterinistc vs. Probabilistic models"
