&lt;p&gt;I'm a Computer Science PhD student at USC, working with Prof. &lt;a href="http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/"&gt;Laurent Itti&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://ilab.usc.edu/"&gt;iLab&lt;/a&gt; and ISI's &lt;a href="https://vimal.isi.edu/"&gt;VIMAL&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- and Prof. Wael Abd-Almageed at ISI's [VIMAL](https://vimal.isi.edu/). --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting my PhD, I studied Mathematics and EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at MIT for my Bachelors and Masters.  Along the way, I interned at a French robotics startup &lt;em&gt;Keecker&lt;/em&gt; and worked at academic research labs at MIT (&lt;a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/"&gt;CSAIL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/camera-culture/overview/"&gt;Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/"&gt;McGovern Institute&lt;/a&gt;) and in INRIA (&lt;a href="https://ilda.saclay.inria.fr/index.html"&gt;ILDA lab&lt;/a&gt;).  After my Masters, I worked at Apple as a COOP for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="research-interests"&gt;Research Interests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="geometric-fingerprints-of-generative-models"&gt;Geometric Fingerprints of Generative Models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, my research interest lies in understanding how complex, high-dimensional information-processing systems (e.g., human intelligence, modern generative models, human movements like traffic patterns) behave and developing efficient algorithms to analyze their characteristics and traces in a principled way, from geometric perspectives. 
Through this geometric understanding of their properties and internal mechanisms, I aim to improve their behaviors (e.g., steering away from degenerative patterns and biases while aligning to more proper values), by mechanistically intervening in their internal causal pathways. Of many such complex systems, my PhD research focuses on generative models and representation learning algorithms.
 &lt;!-- that are responsible for different behavioral characteristics  --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- (e.g., defects in Vision Generative Models, hallucinations in LLMs).  --&gt;
&lt;!--  opt1--&gt;
&lt;!-- current gap --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, despite the rapid development of Generative A.I., there is still a big gap in our understanding and control over their designs and behaviors.
&lt;span class="blue bold"&gt;My aim&lt;/span&gt; is to fill this gap, by developing a formal framework and efficient algorithms that can &lt;strong&gt;represent&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;analyze&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;control&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;behaviors of generative models&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., Large Foundation Models (FMs)) in their high-dimensional spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, I approach these problems from geometric perspectives, and I am working on formalizing the theory of (generative) model behaviors using &lt;strong&gt;Differential Geometry and Riemannian Manifold&lt;/strong&gt;.
Grounded on this theory, I also work to develop efficient algorithms that can extract &lt;strong&gt;geometric signatures&lt;/strong&gt; of the behaviors and internal representations of large generative models (which live on much higher dimensional spaces than what the current geometric approach has been employed (e.g., 1D signals or 3D images) ), 
in order to "fingerprint" and characterize them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end opt1

&lt;!-- opt2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- I am particularly interested in formalizing the theory of generative models -- in particular, their **high-dimensional behaviors**, characteristics (i.e., behavioral **"fingerprints"**) and **controllability** -- from geometric perspectives. 

To this end, I approach my problems by standing on the rich theory of **Differential Geometry and Riemannian Manifold**, and aim to apply theoretical and computational tools from Riemannian geometry to study generative models: their geometric signatures and controllability on their internal mechanisms.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- end opt2 --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img alt="multimodal-inputs" src="/images/my-research-statement/gm-tracing-detectives-ver2.png" style="width:80%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;!-- These geometric signatures will help address many open and arising problems in generative modeling, by providing principled ways to extract and represent the characteristics of different model behaviors (e.g., as vectors) and quantify their differences. --&gt;
&lt;!-- compare different model behaviors and quantify their characteristics. --&gt;
&lt;!-- in numerics, in a vector space. --&gt;
&lt;!--  as formal measures  --&gt;
&lt;!-- For example, using them we can differentiate amongst different Foundation Models, addressing questions like "is this image generated by DALL-E or IMAGEN?" or "is this document from ChatGPT, LLaMA, or human?".
We can also study what makes one model different from another based on their signatures, and investigate their underlying internal mechanisms that cause specific signatures like artifacts in model-generated images or hallucinations in LLMs.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- I also aim to use these geometric signatures to study and control the internal mechanisms of generative models,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- ## My current project on fingerprinting generative models --&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-recent-work-and-extensions_1"&gt;My recent work and extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started on this research endeavor through my work on fingerprinting generative models:
In our recent work published in &lt;a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Song_ManiFPT_Defining_and_Analyzing_Fingerprints_of_Generative_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.html"&gt;CVPR 24&lt;/a&gt;, we proposed a useful theoretical framework to represent model behaviors on a data manifold (i.e., as vector fields on a data manifold constructed from real images).
We also formalized, for
the first time in the literature, the definition of &amp;ldquo;artifacts&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fingerprints&amp;rdquo; of generative models based on their
data manifolds, and proposed an effective attribution method to study and compare vision generative models.
(See more details &lt;a href="/pages/publications.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--  we formalized, for
the first time in the literature, the definition of “artifacts” and “fingerprints” of generative models based on their
data manifolds, and proposed an effective attribution method to study and compare vision generative models --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to extend this work to a larger variety of &lt;strong&gt;Foundation Models&lt;/strong&gt;, including LLMs and SoTA multimodal models, and look into their &lt;strong&gt;internal mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; to identify and &lt;strong&gt;intervene&lt;/strong&gt; causal pathways that are responsible for their fingerprints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- the geometric signatures of generative models, including Foundation Models (FMs) like LLMs and multimodal FMs,  --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope by researching these problems, I will contribute to a geometric theory of generative models and their internal mechanisms, which in turn help shaping a  safe and responsible integration of Generative A.I. into our society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ---

My aim is to develop a formal framework that 
represent the **complex behaviors of generative models** (e.g., Large Foundation Models) in their high-dimensional spaces, 
and efficient algorithms that help analyze their geometric signatures, in order to characterize and differentiate them in a principled way.

To this end, I am working on formalizing the theory of generative models from geometric perspectives -- using the theory of **differential geometry** -- in particular, with respect to their **high-dimensional behaviors**, **characteristics** (i.e., behavioral "fingerprints") and **controllability**.

The 
My approach is grounded on the rich theory of differential geometry and Riemannian Manifold, and I aim to apply theoretical and computational tools from Riemannian geometry to study generative models.

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="research-thread-2"&gt;Research Thread 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- I am interested in how we understand observations from multiple modalities (e.g. images, audio signals and written texts), and how we extract and build representations of the semantics that is invariant across the multimodal observations. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thread of my research lies at the intersection of &lt;strong&gt;representation learning&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;information theory&lt;/strong&gt;, inspired by the way our perceptual system integrates &lt;strong&gt;multimodal&lt;/strong&gt; sensory inputs via identifying &lt;strong&gt;invariant semantics&lt;/strong&gt;.  I am interested in understanding how the &lt;strong&gt;semantic information&lt;/strong&gt; flows while processing observations from multiple modalities, using tools in deep learning and thermodynamic approaches to information flow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guiding question is, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we  extract the shared semantics from observations expressed in vastly different representational forms (eg. images,  sounds, written texts), and how do we create/actualize various forms of observations, starting from the semantics we want to communicate?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img alt="multimodal-inputs" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fcocoaaa%2FOzdNmX2UzQ.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=b246a2e5-5e52-418d-8c96-afbbbe84d1b7" style="width:60%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approach this question from an information-processing point of view and am developing &lt;strong&gt;generative models&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;disentangled representation&lt;/strong&gt; to jointly learn the analysis and synthesis processes of multimodal data.  My most recent work introduces a generative model with adversarial training that learns spatial semantics from map tiles collected from diverse sources such as satellites, Google Street Map and custom rendering engines.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- - Read more about our dataset of multi-style map tiles ([TBA](#))
- Read more about our work on Learning a structured ... ([TBA](#)) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am exploring different ways to understand our proposed model, in particular, by measuring semantic information and studying the flow of information between the latent partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we can quantify the amount of the shared semantic information captured by our model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we view each latent partition as a subsystem that constitutes a global system represented by the whole latent space, then we can view the the adversarial discriminator as a demon (like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon"&gt;Maxwell's Demon&lt;/a&gt;) sitting at the boarder of the latent subsystems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--- (How) does the adversary -- the demon sitting at the boarder of the content and style latent partitions -- achieve the non-equilibrium state of the semantic vs. domain-specific information by "sorting" or "organizing" the information into the correct partition as the training happens?--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From this point of view, (how) does this adversary -- the demon sitting at the boarder of the content and style latent partitions -- achieve the non-equilibrium state of the semantic vs. domain-specific information by "sorting" or "organizing" the information into the correct partition as the training happens?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's exciting to see how the ideas and tools in thermodynamics can help quantify and visualize this flow of semantic information in our model!&lt;/p&gt;

My journey started from noticing our own ability to (i) break down a complex observation into multiple chunks of smaller and abstract concepts and (ii) create a new idea by playing and recombining the conceptual building blocks.  For instance, we can take a glimpse of this dance between abstraction and synthesis in a video of Picasso's live drawing:

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe "="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JU9oaD0e7uU" width="672"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

More specifically, I'm intrigued by how seamlessly we extract a common semantic content from observations in vastly different representational forms (such as languages, images, gestures or sounds, and infinitely many forms within each modality), and reversely, how a semantic content can be expressed in various forms without losing its (overall) meaning
&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-note"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-note" type="checkbox"/&gt;
&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;
Hmm.. coarse-graining?&lt;/span&gt;.

My exploration starts with an hypothesis that a phenomena in reality, from which
our observations stem from, contains __semantic potentials__("potential" as in
_potential energy_ in Physics, or going further up the stream, as in Aristotle's
["Potentiality and actuality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality)
&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-note"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-note" type="checkbox"/&gt;
&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;
This idea influenced Leibniz to develop the science of "dynamics". 
Learning about such influence brings light into what Leibniz was struggling to hit the chord with ideas like 'power' and 'action'. Contemplate: Aristotle's "potential:actuality" vs. Leibniz's "power:action"&lt;/span&gt;
.) 

I wonder,

- What is the relationship between _semantic information_&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-note"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-note" type="checkbox"/&gt;
&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;
See [An Outline of a Theory of Semantic Information](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/4821/RLE-TR-247-03150899.pdf?sequence=1), a [survey](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/), and more recent work by [Kolchinsky and Wolpert](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0041)
&lt;/span&gt;
and _semantic potential_, i.e. the underlying _field_ from which individual observations are actualized into an instance of a natural phenomena, an event?
- What is the process -- or geometric constraints -- that leads the same semantics to different representational forms? Can we learn this process from multimodal data?
- What is the process through which an observer builds an understanding -- an internal representation -- of an event?
    - What is the process through which we identify, extract and encode the invariant semantics from observations in diverse modalities?
    - How can we define and measure the semantic information in our representations, efficiently?
- Can we model these processes by __learning a generative model from data collected from multiple modalities__?

## Specific Example
For instance, consider the following observations: $X^A$ is an image of a dog barking on the door, $X^B$ is a recording of a dog barking, and $X^C$ is a sentence written in the English language. The semantic content shared among the observations is "there is a dog barking", and each observation is the result of expressing (synm: rendering, stylizing) the semantic content into a form proper for its modality (ie. image, sound, written English language, respectively). 

My question, at the representational level is, how do we identify the underlying, shared semantic contents from the information about domain-specific variations? 
![multi-modal-encoding-of-semantics](/images/semantic_potential/encoding-semantics-from-origin.png)

- How do we _identify_ what is the type of information that is invariant among observations from multiple domains?
- What discovery process goes into separating the shared contents (invariance across domain) from the domain-specifics?  
- Can we use learning-based approaches to build a computational model of such process (i)more efficiently, (ii)by leveraging large amounts of data available?

Now let's flip the question and consider the process of synthesis. I start with a concept that I'd like to express and communicate. For example, I want to actualize the idea of "a dog barking at the door". If I ask you to express this content as an image, sounds, and an English sentence, what would be the process of such domain-specific actualization of a semantic information?
![generating-semantics-in-multi-domains](/images/semantic_potential/generating-semantics-in-multiple-domains.png)

- What is the process of recombining the encoded representations to make better decisions, derive new conclusions? In particular, what is the underlying structure that defines each modality?

Geometry of a modality space: imposes geometric constraints that an instance must satisfy to be a valid observations of that modality
![geometry-of-modality-space](/images/semantic_potential/geometry-of-modality-space.png)

- E.g. an observation in an image form must satisfy a different set of geometric constraints than that in an acoustic form.
- Can we learn a model of such geometric rules via a generative model with neural networks?

The breakdown of main components of my questions looks as follows:

- Semantic information: Address a limitation of Shannon's theory of Information&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-note"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-note" type="checkbox"/&gt;
&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;
The symmetry axiom of Shannon's entropy preserves the syntactic meaning in symbols, yet disregards their identities. See [ITTP2018](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/it.pdf)&lt;/span&gt;.
- Semantic potentials == a natural phenomena -- is this what "nature" is defined as?
- The process of actualizing semantic potentials/information to different modalities
- The process during which an observer builds an understanding of the actualized data point
- Geometry of modality space: what is the underlying geometry that defines an observation as a valid image vs. a valid human voice vs. a valid text?

## Research Statement
### Learning a generative model of multimodal representation
In pursuit of this computational model of understanding and generating multimodal data, I am developing generative models with disentangled representation to jointly learn the analysis and synthesis processes of complex, high-dimensional data (eg. satellite images, knowledge bases) with compact and &amp;ldquo;meaningful&amp;rdquo; representations.&amp;nbsp; 
I'm working with Prof. Wael Abd-Almageed at ISI's [VIMAL](https://vimal.isi.edu/), 
focusing on various types of generative models for this goal.
My project with  Prof. [Yao-Yi Chiang](https://spatial.usc.edu/team-view/yao-yi-chiang/) and Prof. [Craig Knoblock](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/knoblock/) tackles this line of questions using geospatial data, and aims to learn spatial semantics from data that are collected from diverse sources (eg. satellites, Google Street Map, historical maps) and stored in diverse format (eg. images, graphs). This work has potential applications such as global-scale urban environment analysis, automated map synthesis and systems for monitoring environmental changes.

Within the domain of representation learning, I&amp;rsquo;m most interested in variational inference methods, especially recent developments in deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the idea of adversarial training. 

Using a VAE-variant model and adversarial training, I&amp;rsquo;m investigating how we can build a model that extracts invariance in a dataset of heterogeneous representations via VAEs and adversarial training.&amp;nbsp; One of my current projects investigates this question in the domain of spatial informatics, using our new dataset of map tiles from diverse sources.

### Next itches
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;More about next steps...&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding adversary at the latent space from the perspectives of information flow and non-equilibrium achieved by the adversary, ie. the Maxwell's Demon at the gate that distinguishes the two latent partitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GAN models are often described in the framework of min-max games between a generator and an adversary. In particular, there has been works making a connection between Nash Equilibrium and local minimum of the GAN's objective function. This connection motivates me to view my adversary (at the latent partitions) as an 'information sorter', like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon"&gt;Maxwell's Demon&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of this information sorter is to organize the semantic information into one latent partition, and the domain-specific information into the other latent partition, so that each partition (equivalent to a gas chamber in Maxwell's thought experiment) contains only its type of information.  This approach will allow me to bring in computational tools from information theory and theromodynamics (flow of information) to understand how the adversarial information sorter actually achieves the partitioned latent space. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation of the disentangled partition requires a measure of semantic information &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to evaluate how well our semantic latent space captures the semantic information in the inputs, we first need a well grounded _definition of the semantic information_, as well as _computational methods to efficiently compute_ the value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See &lt;a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/4821/RLE-TR-247-03150899.pdf?sequence=1"&gt;An Outline of a Theory of Semantic Information&lt;/a&gt;, a nice &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, and more recent work by &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0041"&gt;Kolchinsky and Wolpert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linking the discovered latent factors to external knowledge graph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;!--     - How can we map the learned latent factors to concepts in a more global knowledge graph (eg. Wikipedia)?--&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

## TMI: How much is Too Much Information?
More importantly, I'm practicing to:  
- observe without being entangled in what is personal
- look at small thoughts carefully
- not to rush
- spend most of time on what matters most
- be gentle 
- be slow
- be curious
- question
- relax in discomforts
- greet what is as what is
&lt;!-- - nothing more, nothing less --&gt;
- stay open

I worry that too much hopping from the domain of AI/ML to physics, and then ultimately to philosophy will worry my PhD advisors. When the worry quiets itself, however, I see that beaconings of uncomfortable inklings/curious itches often point me to exactly what I should be doing at any moment.

studying the lower-dimensional representation of complex unstructured datasets (eg. multi-spectral satellite images, 3D MRI scans) using deep learning. My work lies in the intersection of statistical machine learning, information theory and coding theory.  I also work on interactive visualization of high-dimensional datasets and complex models (eg. deep neural nets) for a guide to better insight and understanding.

Before my PhD, I was at MIT studying Mathematics and EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) for my undergraduate and Masters. After Masters, I interned at Apple as a coop for 9 months.  I also worked on a cool French robotics startup (Keecker) and several academic research labs (MIT CSAIL, MIT Media Lab and INRIA) during my studies.

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science PhD at USC working on a computational model of multimodal representation using generative models.  
My research interest lies at the intersection of representation learning and information theory, inspired by the way our perceptual system integrates multimodal sensory inputs via identifying invariant semantics.  

Before my PhD, I was at MIT studying Mathematics and EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) for my undergraduate and Masters.  During my studies, I interned at a French robotics startup (Keecker) and academic research labs in MIT CSAIL, MIT Media Lab and INRIA.  After Masters, I worked at Apple as a COOP for 9 months.

My journey started from noticing our own ability to (i) break down a complex observation into multiple chunks of smaller and abstract concepts and (ii) create a new idea by playing and recombining the conceptual building blocks.  For instance, we can take a glimpse of this process of abstraction and synthesis in this video of Picasso's live drawing.
