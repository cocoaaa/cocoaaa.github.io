<p>Hello! I'm Hayley, and I'm a Computer Science PhD student at <strong>University of Southern California</strong> (USC). 
I am excited about problems regarding human perception of the world and how symbolic representation of knowledge can facilitate learning in a new domain via information transfer and generalization across domains and modalities.</p>
<p>My research lies at the intersection of <strong>representation learning</strong> and <strong>information</strong> theory, inspired by the way our perceptual system integrates <strong>multimodal</strong> sensory inputs via identifying <strong>invariant semantics</strong>. </p>
<p>My current guiding question is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we, an intelligent agent, understand observations from multiple modalities (e.g. images, audio signals and written texts), and </p>
<p>How do we extract and build representations of the semantics that is invariant across the multimodal observations?</p>
<p>How do we represent the model's behaviors formally and measure their characteristics to distinguish one another?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am developing generative models to jointly learn the analysis and synthesis processes of multimodal data.  My most recent work introduces a <strong>generative model with disentangled representation</strong> that learns spatial semantics from map tiles collected from diverse sources such as satellites, Google Street Map and custom rendering engines.
I am also interested in understanding how the <strong>semantic information</strong> flows while processing observations from multiple modalities, using tools in deep learning and thermodynamic approaches to information flow.</p>

In a bigger scheme, I am excited about the problems regarding human perception of 
the world and how symbolic representation of knowledge can facilitate learning 
in a new domain <em>via knowledge transfer across various domains/modalities</em>.  I'm continuously exploring these questions in my research:

<ul>
<li> How can intelligent agents learn with less supervision, particularly in the domain of vision and three-dimensional perception (<todo>:spatial reasonging?)</todo></li>
<ul>
<li>via autonomously interacting with the environment</li>
<li>via incorporating external knowledge</li>
<li>via incorporating common sense reasoning</li>
</ul>
   My [project](#semantic_road_project) on road detection from satellite images explores this question using external geospatial knowledge base (OpenStreetMap) and transfer learning. 

<li>How can those knowledge be represented in a more abstract form so that it can be used for learning in different domains</li>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge Representation, Transfer Learning, Domain Adaptation</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>I use Python (eg. <strong>PyTorch</strong>, Numpy, scikit-learn) for machine learning
<a href="#">projects</a> and C++ for hardware systems (eg. Microsoft Kinnect and Intel RealSense) as in <a href="#">this</a> project. </p>

<p>Besides working on my projects, I enjoy being in nature and trying out different sports. 
Along the way, I became a certified scuba diver and have sky-dived in Czech sky! 
I enjoy biking and swimming -- they help me connect to the dimension that 
is not about thinking and analyzing, and remind me we are more than our 
thoughts and minds. I enjoy sharing such experiences with friends:)</p>
<p>I occasionally write <a href="/blog_index">here</a> to process and share what I learn. I would love to hear from you if you have any questions or thoughts:)</p>

 we can use our understandings of the world to develop intelligent systems 
that can interactive with the dynamic environments as we, humans, do. 



I am interested in combining the geometric 
understandings with the semanic interpretations of a scene as the first step towards this goal.

Previously, I worked in image registration (aka. Optical Flow) and three-dimensional perception computer vision and 
how human intelligence can efficiently learn via interaction with the
environments as well as ho
interaction and intelligent systems that what we call 'intelligence' is, particularly in the domain of 
vision, perception and knowledge representation.  One way to study it is via reverse-engineer 
artificial systems that can computer vision and three-dimensional perception.

2D images and 3D data (such as RGB-D) 

Recognition: What makes us recognize an object 
as what it is (e.g. a bird as a bird, a bull as a bull)? What is the necessary and 
sufficient representation of an object for human recognition? This question has been 
lingering on my mind ever since I saw a video of Picasso at work:
